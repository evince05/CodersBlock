# Introduction

This repository contains all the code from CodersBlock sessions 1-3. It has all the items, commands, and features we created.

# Session 1

In Session 1, we created some fun features to spice up your Minecraft server. The Ghast Blade is a powerful (and explosive) new weapon,
and the Super Stone Tools make mining that much faster!

## Ghast Blade

The Ghast Blade is a special sword that can shoot fireballs!
It has a custom recipe of a stick, ghast tear, and fire charge.

The Ghast Blade functions like a normal sword with fire aspect.
However, when you right click, it shoots an explosive fireball!
This ability has a 5 second cooldown.

## The Crossbow of Legends

The Crossbow of Legends is a super powerful, super fast crossbow!
It has Multishot 7 and Quick Charge 4, making it the perfect tool to keep mobs at bay.

You can craft it using a crossbow, two dispensers, and two netherite ingots.

Watch it work its magic!

## Exploding Horses

This feature is a fun prank for your friends. Use a name tag to name a horse "Boom",
and whenever someone tries to ride that horse, it explodes!

## Super Stone Tools

Super Stone Tools makes stone tools much more useful. Now, all stone tools
(pickaxe, axe, shovel, hoe) automatically receive Efficiency 25!

# Session 2

Session 2 was SUPER cool (pun totally intended), since we added superpowers! Also, we created pickaxes that 
have a chance to drop upgraded ores when you mine certain ores.

## Superpowers

## Upgraded Pickaxes

# Session 3

Session 3 saw a whole range of new features in their Minecraft server. We made DoubleDrops to make mining twice as fun, 
and we added a feature where players could ride any mob - even the Ender Dragon! Most importantly, players could choose a tribe
to receive custom abilities and powerups in-game.

## DoubleDrops

## Ride The Mob

## Tribes
