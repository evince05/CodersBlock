# Introduction

This repository contains all the code from CodersBlock sessions 1-3. It has all the items, commands, and features we created.

# Session 1

In Session 1, we created some fun features to spice up your Minecraft server. The Ghast Blade is a powerful (and explosive) new weapon,
and the Super Stone Tools make mining that much faster!

# Session 2

Session 2 was SUPER cool (pun totally intended), since we added superpowers! Also, we created pickaxes that 
have a chance to drop upgraded ores when you mine certain ores.

## Upgraded Pickaxes

# Session 3

Session 3 saw a whole range of new features in their Minecraft server. We made DoubleDrops to make mining twice as fun, 
and we added a feature where players could ride any mob - even the Ender Dragon! Most importantly, players could choose a tribe
to receive custom abilities and powerups in-game.

## Ride The Mob
