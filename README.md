# Introduction

This repository contains all the code from CodersBlock sessions 1-3. It has all the items, commands, and features we created.

# Session 1

In Session 1, we created some fun features to spice up your Minecraft server. The Ghast Blade is a powerful (and explosive) new weapon,
and the Super Stone Tools make mining that much faster!

## Ghast Blade

The Ghast Blade is a special sword that can shoot fireballs!
It has a custom recipe of a stick, ghast tear, and fire charge.

The Ghast Blade functions like a normal sword with fire aspect.
However, when you right click, it shoots an explosive fireball!
This ability has a 5 second cooldown.

## The Crossbow of Legends

The Crossbow of Legends is a super powerful, super fast crossbow!
It has Multishot 7 and Quick Charge 4, making it the perfect tool to keep mobs at bay.

You can craft it using a crossbow, two dispensers, and two netherite ingots.

Watch it work its magic!

## Exploding Horses

This feature is a fun prank for your friends. Use a name tag to name a horse "Boom",
and whenever someone tries to ride that horse, it explodes!

## Super Stone Tools

Super Stone Tools makes stone tools much more useful. Now, all stone tools
(pickaxe, axe, shovel, hoe) automatically receive Efficiency 25!

# Session 2

Session 2 was SUPER cool (pun totally intended), since we added superpowers! Also, we created pickaxes that 
have a chance to drop upgraded ores when you mine certain ores.

## Superpowers

Every player that joins the server receives a superpower to help them in-game!
Superpowers include Jump Boost, Haste, Water Breathing, Night Vision, and Invisibility!

Players can toggle their superpower using /sp.

Also, certain superpowers have special abilities! For example, the Jump Boost superpower gives players 3 seconds of
Slow Falling, so they can jump and glide to safety.

## Upgraded Pickaxes

In this feature, most ores have a chance to drop a bonus, upgraded ore!
These extra ores will making your caving trips that much better.

When you mine iron, you have a chance to get a bonus gold ingot.

When you mine gold, you have a chance to get a bonus diamond!

# Session 3

Session 3 saw a whole range of new features in their Minecraft server. We made DoubleDrops to make mining twice as fun, 
and we added a feature where players could ride any mob - even the Ender Dragon! Most importantly, players could choose a tribe
to receive custom abilities and powerups in-game.

## DoubleDrops

When mining, this feature doubles certain items! Items like logs, cobblestone, crops, and dirt will double when you mine them.

## Ride The Mob

When holding a saddle, right-click a mob to ride it! You can ride any mob - chickens, villagers, even the wither!

## Tribes

Players can choose a tribe to receive special powers!

Earth Tribe - Mining speed, faster crop growth, extra health
Wind Tribe - Faster movement, double jump, slow falling
Fire Tribe - Walking on lava, auto smelt ores, auto fire aspect
Water Tribe - Water breathing, faster swim speed, faster mining underwater
